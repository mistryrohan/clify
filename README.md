```Spotify top artists and songs visualizer: clify-omega.vercel.app```

If you have issues logging in, it is because Spotify has a limit on the number of users that can access the application, contact me and I can add you to the user list!

This app was created using Next.Js and React, deployed using Vercel. The Spotify Web API permissions only request the users top artists and playlist information, not any personal information, you can log out and remove permissions at any time in your Spotify account settings.
